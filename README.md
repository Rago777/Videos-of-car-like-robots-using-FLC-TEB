# TEB.mp4: Video 1

This video showcases the motion of a car-like robot in an experimental setting, visualized within RViz using the classical TEB (Timed Elastic Band) algorithm.

# FLC-TEB.mp4: Video 2

In this video, the motion of a car-like robot is visualized in RViz using the proposed FLC-TEB (Fuzzy Logic Controller - Timed Elastic Band) algorithm within the same experimental environment.
